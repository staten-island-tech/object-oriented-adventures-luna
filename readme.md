# Legacy

## Introduction/Prologue

The MC and their sibling would be traveling from world to world. They are stopping at a space station for supplies, when the station is attacked by a group of criminals, "The Oblivion". Here they would encounter them and try to stop them, but fail. 

The player would then choose between the female character or the male character.

After choosing a character, the other sibling would be captured, while the MC would escape (probably through their sibling's sacrifice). They will be found by a group of travelers who help him/her to recovery. The group of travelers call themselves, "Legacy". It composes of the captain (guide/tutorial person), Asahi(free character), and other npcs(gives missions).

    Let the MC choose:
        1: Travel alone
            End of the game with a short log from the MC (will be written later)
                - Probably on adventure
        2: Travel with the group of travelers
            The game will continue...
                Travel through different worlds(3-4) before final battle
                Decisions will decide the reunion of the siblings
                Travel by spaceship
